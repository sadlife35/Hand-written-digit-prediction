Title of Project:Handwritten Digit Classification using MNIST Dataset 
Objective:To build a machine learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
Data Source:The MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits. The dataset is available from TensorFlow/Keras datasets.
Import Library:import tensorflow as tffrom tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnistfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequentialfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, Flatten, MaxPooling2Dfrom tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categoricalimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npImport Data:# Load the MNIST dataset(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
Describe Data:print(f"Training data shape: {X_train.shape}")print(f"Training labels shape: {y_train.shape}")print(f"Test data shape: {X_test.shape}")print(f"Test labels shape: {y_test.shape}")
Data Visualization:# Visualize some of the training datafig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 3, figsize=(9, 9))for i, ax in enumerate(axes.flat):ax.imshow(X_train[i], cmap='binary')ax.set(title=f"Label: {y_train[i]}")ax.axis('off')plt.show()
Data Preprocessing:# Reshape and normalize the imagesX_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1) / 255.0X_test = X_test.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1) / 255.0# One-hot encode the labelsy_train = to_categorical(y_train)y_test = to_categorical(y_test)Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X):# Feature variables (X) are the imagesX = X_train# Target variable (y) are the labelsy = y_trainDefine Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X):
Train Test Split:The MNIST dataset is already split into training and test sets by default. If needed, we can split the training set further into training and validation sets, but for simplicity, we will use the provided split.
Modeling:# Build the CNN modelmodel = Sequential([    Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),    Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'),    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),    Flatten(),    Dense(128, activation='relu'),    Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Output layer for 10 classes (digits 0-9)])# Compile the modelmodel.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])# Train the modelhistory = model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), epochs=10, batch_size=200)
Model Evaluation:# Evaluate the model on the test datascore = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)print('Test loss:', score[0])print('Test accuracy:', score[1])
Prediction:# Make predictions on the test datapredictions = model.predict(X_test)# Plot some predictionsfig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 3, figsize=(9, 9))for i, ax in enumerate(axes.flat):ax.imshow(X_test[i].reshape(28, 28), cmap='binary') ax.set(title=f"Pred: {predictions[i].argmax()}\nTrue: {y_test[i].argmax()}")ax.axis('off' plt.show()
Explanation:This project demonstrates the classification analysis of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a standard benchmark in machine learning for image processing tasks. We employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) due to its effectiveness in handling image data. The data was preprocessed by normalizing and reshaping the images and one-hot encoding the labels. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set, achieving high accuracy. Predictions were visualized to compare the model's output with the true labels, showcasing the model's performance.
